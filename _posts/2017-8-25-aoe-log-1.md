Here begins my journey through Hacking: The Art of Exploitation. Not quite sure where to start doing exercises, so I'll start at the beginning then trust the heart of the cards.

firstprog.c, woo, printing hello world ten times. Time for a gdb refresher.

What is this? Just when I got used to the weird-ass x86 register names (ARM ftw), they change it? The registers aren't named 'eax' etc., as expected. Turns out x64 registers, 64-bit extensions of the x86 registers, are prefixed with r. x64 also adds 8 new 64-bit registers, r8-r16 (yess, ARM names).
Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/x64-architecture
Cool note: the lower 32, 16, and 8 bits are directly addressable. The names (rax, eax, ax, al) show successive extensions of the original 16-bit ax register.

rax - accumulator
rbx - base
rcx - counter
rdx - data
general purpose, used as temporary variables

rsp - stack pointer
rbp - base pointer
rsi - source index
rdi - destination index
rsi and rdi commonly used to point to src/dest when data read/written
also general purpose

rip - instruction pointer
eflags - bit flags for comparisons and memory segmentation

cs to gs aren't mentioned in the book. They are memory segment registers, but segmentation has been replaced by paging, so they are used for assorted internal functions.

Seems like the kinda thing I'll learn more about when/if I need to. Moving on.

Quit gdb with 'quit'. (Bet you forgot we were still in gdb.)

x86 assembly syntax comes in two main types: AT&T and Intel. AT&T syntax prefixes register names with "%" and values with "$". Intel doesn't, and writes "DWORD PTR [<reg> [+ offset]]" instead of addresses at times. I have not divined exactly when/why. Erickson prefers Intel syntax, so we're going with that.

Setting disassembly syntax type for gdb:
(gdb running) set dis[assembly] intel
echo "set dis intel" > ~/.gdbinit

Good to know the order of operands: in Intel syntax, it goes:
opcode <dest>, <src>

Ohohoho, now we make debugging easy mode and continue the gdb review. (This is good, I haven't used it in a couple years.)
gcc -g firstprog.c
gdb -q ./a.out

Oooh la la. Unexpected error!
/home/rad/.gdbinit:1: Error in sourced command file:
Ambiguous set command "dis intel": disable-randomization, disassemble-next-line, disassembly-flavor, disconnected-dprintf...

Looks like something's changed since 2008.
help set
help set disassembly-flavor
Yep, this is it. Acceptable values: intel, att (default). .gdbinit updated with disassembly-flavor instead of dis. It's a bingo! No more errors for edward.

Let's compare this to the book.

0x08048384 <main+0>: push ebp
0x08048385 <main+1>: mov ebp,esp
0x08048387 <main+3>: sub esp,0x8
0x0804838a <main+6>: and esp,0xfffffff0
0x0804838d <main+9>: mov eax,0x0
0x08048392 <main+14>: sub esp,eax
0x08048394 <main+16>: mov DWORD PTR [ebp-4],0x0
0x0804839b <main+23>: cmp DWORD PTR [ebp-4],0x9
0x0804839f <main+27>: jle 0x80483a3 <main+31>
0x080483a1 <main+29>: jmp 0x80483b6 <main+50>
0x080483a3 <main+31>: mov DWORD PTR [esp],0x80484d4
0x080483aa <main+38>: call 0x80482a8 <_init+56>
0x080483af <main+43>: lea eax,[ebp-4]
0x080483b2 <main+46>: inc DWORD PTR [eax]
0x080483b4 <main+48>: jmp 0x804839b <main+23>
0x080483b6 <main+50>: leave
0x080483b7 <main+51>: ret

On my box, the function prologue (everything before mov DWORD PTR [ebp/rbp-4],0x0) is shorter (and doesn't do silly things like subtract 0 from esp. Anyone know why that happens? My best guess is that it does something to the status bits in eflags). The jumps and comparisons for the for loop are in a different order; mine uses fewer jumps as a result. Different instructions are used to increment i. I don't know what "lea" is yet, but I'm guessing it stands for "load effective address" and loads an address to use as an argument for other instructions. i must be located at ebp/rpb-4 and add/inc are used to i++.

Most interesting difference: the book asm calls printf, even though the source code doesn't use any format strings (printf("Hello, world!\n")). I know _init+56 refers to printf from the objdump output in the book. My gcc subbed in puts, since printf(<string literal>) is effectively puts. Why did mine optimize and the book's didn't?

Open questions:
What does "lea rdi,..." do? Is it related to the call? My guess: it loads the address of the "Hello, world!\n" string literal and that gets passed to puts as a parameter. Is rdi used for passing parameters? Gotta look into calling conventions.
What is a good reference for x86 assembly?

Moving along~. Still in gdb, did you forget again?
break main
run
info register eip
x/o $rip // examine contents of rip, display in octal
x/x $rip // hex
x/u $rip // unsigned decimal
x/t $rip // binary
x/2x $rip // show two four-byte words in hex

If you accidentally write "$eip" because you're looking at the book (RIP), it'll tell you "Value can't be converted to integer." but if you try "eip", it says "No symbol "eip" in current context." Does it recognize $eip as the lower 32 bits of rip but can't use those 32 bits as a memory address to examine? Or does it try and find some weird stuff? What could be at a memory location that can't be converted to an integer?

So, by default, x displays memory in four-byte chunks. If my box is 64-bit, does that just mean the addresses and address space are 64 bits, or does it affect memory layout and word sizes and such? Does a 64-bit address point to a 32-bit memory location? 64-bit? A byte? Looking at the disassembly, instructions are sometimes a single address apart. Looking at objdump, instructions are sometimes a single byte (e.g. push rbp = 55). So, it must be byte-addressable.

(gdb) x/2xw $rip
0x555555554642 <main+8>:	0x00fc45c7	0xeb000000
(gdb) x/2xb $rip
0x555555554642 <main+8>:	0xc7	0x45
(gdb) x/2xb $rip+1
0x555555554643 <main+9>:	0x45	0xfc

Confirmed. Also, ooh la la, little endian!

Other unit size modifiers for x:
h - halfword, two bytes
g - giant, eight bytes

Looks like the unit size is sticky: if you don't specify, the last size is used (or the default, if you haven't specified anything yet).

Now we quit gdb and learn about a calculator! Oooh I love command line utilities. GUIs make me sick. bc is an "arbitrary precision calculator language" (source: man bc) with interactive input. Looks like it has complex syntax with statements, functions, etc., etc., but Erickson just uses it to show little vs big endian.
reader@hacking:~/booksrc $ bc -ql
199*(256^3) + 69*(256^2) + 252*(256^1) + 0*(256^0)

Back to gdb:
x/i // interprets memory as an instruction
I bet this would be good for finding unintended "offset" instructions to point to and execute.
(gdb) x/i $rip

Only the first and last instructions are actually part of the program. I remember reading somewhere that this technique is used for code golf/demoscene/applications where the code needs to be as small as possible. It can take less space to jump partway into an existing instruction than add an entirely new one. I vaguely remember something about using it for constants too: instead of wasting space in the data section to store a value, find the value in the code somewhere and copy it from there.

An unabridged but abortive attempt to figure out what lea rpi,[rip+0xa2] does.
(gdb) x/s $rip+0xa2

0x5555555546fc:	111	114	108	100	33	0	0	0

Next tactic: break before and after "lea rdi,..." and inspect rdi.
break *main+17
continue
info registers # rdi = 0x1
nexti # step to next instruction, executing lea ldi,...
info registers # rdi = 0x5555555546f4, note this is the second last address in the output of x/32ub $rip+0xa2!
x $rdi # 72 (ooh la la, ASCII H)
x/s $rdi # Hello, world!

Sooo! It does load a pointer to "Hello, world!" into rdi. Looks like something went wrong with the pointer arithmetic when I tried to examine rip+0xa2, since it resolved to 0x5555555546e4 instead of 0x5555555546f4.

Now, how does rdi pass the pointer to puts? To the calling conventions!
